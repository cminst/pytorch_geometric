#2 pointcloud_optimizations - This pull request introduces several improvements to the 3D point cloud experiment pipeline, focusing on dataset flexibility, data loading efficiency, and data augmentation capabilities. The most significant changes include a major refactor of the `ScanObjectNN` dataset class to support multiple variants, the addition of an affine augmentation transform, and new options for caching and parallelizing data loading to speed up preprocessing and evaluation.
#7 pointwavelet - This pull request includes a PointWavelet-L implementation and improved CLI scripts for PointMLP, PointTransformer, and DGCNN. Added plotting scripts and also other repos.
